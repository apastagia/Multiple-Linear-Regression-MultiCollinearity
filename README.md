Multiple linear regression is a model for predicting the value of one dependent variable based on two or more independent variables.

You can use multiple linear regression when you want to know:

* How strong the relationship is between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable (e.g. how rainfall, temperature, and amount of fertilizer added affect crop growth).
* The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variables (e.g. the expected yield of a crop at certain levels of rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer addition).
